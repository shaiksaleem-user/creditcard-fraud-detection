Credit Card Fraud Detection - Project Report
1. Introduction
Credit card fraud detection is an essential task in preventing financial losses for both banks and cardholders. In this project, we aim to build a machine learning model that can detect fraudulent transactions using a publicly available dataset. The dataset contains anonymized transaction features and labels indicating whether a transaction was fraudulent or not.

2. Problem Statement
The goal is to classify credit card transactions as either fraudulent or non-fraudulent. Given the imbalanced nature of the dataset, the challenge is to correctly identify fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives and negatives.

3. Dataset Overview
Dataset Source: Kaggle (Credit Card Fraud Detection)

Dataset Size: 284,807 transactions, with 492 fraud cases (0.172% fraud rate)

Features: The dataset contains 30 anonymized features (V1 to V28), along with Time and Amount. The target label is a binary classification indicating fraud (1) or non-fraud (0).

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Missing Values: The dataset does not contain any missing values, making it easier to preprocess.

Class Distribution: The target variable is highly imbalanced, with a very small percentage of fraud cases. We will use techniques like resampling or adjusting class weights to address this imbalance.

Feature Analysis: Feature engineering and transformations were performed to ensure that the data is suitable for machine learning models.

Key Findings:
The target variable is imbalanced, requiring special attention to ensure good classification performance.

Time and Amount features are important for fraud detection, and we performed standardization for the Amount feature.

5. Data Preprocessing
Standardization: We used StandardScaler to standardize features like Amount and any other numeric features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

Resampling: Techniques like Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) or class weight adjustments were applied to deal with the class imbalance.

6. Model Development and Evaluation
6.1 Models Used:
Logistic Regression: A basic linear model to classify fraudulent transactions.

Random Forest Classifier: A tree-based ensemble model that helps capture complex patterns.

XGBoost: A gradient boosting machine model that provides high accuracy in classification tasks.

6.2 Model Performance:
Logistic Regression:
Accuracy: 98%

Precision: 1.00 (Class 0), 0.06 (Class 1)

Recall: 0.98 (Class 0), 0.92 (Class 1)

F1-Score: 0.99 (Class 0), 0.11 (Class 1)

ROC-AUC: 0.9721

Random Forest Classifier:
Accuracy: 100%

Precision: 1.00 (Class 0), 0.96 (Class 1)

Recall: 1.00 (Class 0), 0.74 (Class 1)

F1-Score: 1.00 (Class 0), 0.84 (Class 1)

ROC-AUC: 0.9528

XGBoost Classifier:
Accuracy: 100%

Precision: 1.00 (Class 0), 0.85 (Class 1)

Recall: 1.00 (Class 0), 0.84 (Class 1)

F1-Score: 1.00 (Class 0), 0.85 (Class 1)

ROC-AUC: 0.9796

PR-AUC: 0.8734

Confusion Matrices:
Each modelâ€™s confusion matrix was evaluated to understand the true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. The models demonstrated excellent performance in identifying non-fraudulent transactions, with some trade-off in detecting fraudulent ones due to the class imbalance.

7. Model Interpretation and Feature Importance
Random Forest and XGBoost provided feature importance rankings that highlighted which features were most crucial for detecting fraud. These models helped in understanding the relationship between features like Time, Amount, and fraud occurrences.

8. Model Deployment
The trained models were saved using joblib and can be deployed into a production environment to monitor new credit card transactions and flag potential fraud.

9. Conclusion
Key Takeaways:

The models, especially Random Forest and XGBoost, performed exceptionally well in detecting fraudulent transactions.

The issue of class imbalance was mitigated using appropriate resampling and class weighting techniques.

XGBoost provided the best performance overall, with high recall and precision for both classes.

Future Work:

Implementing a more complex pipeline for continuous monitoring and retraining with new data.

Experimenting with other advanced models and tuning hyperparameters further.
